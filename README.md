# SAM - Canada #
These Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) were created from the following Statistics Canada sources:
* Table 36-10-0111-01: Current and capital accounts - National, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0112-01: Current and capital accounts - Households, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0114-01: Compensation of employees, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0115-01: Current and capital accounts - Non-profit institutions serving households, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0116-01: Current and capital accounts - Corporations, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0117-01: Undistributed corporation profits, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0118-01: Current and capital accounts - General governments, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0121-01: Current and capital accounts - Non-residents, Canada, quarterly, 1961-2020.
* Table 36-10-0478-01: Supply and use tables, detail level, provincial and territorial, 2010-2016.
* Table 36-10-0578-01: Financial Flow Accounts, 1990-2020.

In total, there are 857 accounts and their aggregation is the most granular available, which is the **detail level**.

The balancing of tables is done using linear programming, which modifies the inter-agent transfers so that all of the accounts are balanced, so there is minimal table intervention. The procedure and code for creating these tables will be posted later on.

A high-level diagram of how these accounts relate to each other and the number of accounts in each macro-acount is shown here:
